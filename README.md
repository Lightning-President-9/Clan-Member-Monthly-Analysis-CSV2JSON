# Clan-Member-Monthly-Analysis-CSV2JSON

This is a reference repository used to transform clan member data gathered from [ClanDataRepo](https://github.com/Lightning-President-9/ClanDataRepo) to be analyzed and reported monthly in JSON format. The main reason for this transformation is to make data visualization easier, since JSON is used for fetching data for Clan Member and Former Member Graph.

The Jupyter Notebook **ClanMemMonAnaJSON2CSV.ipynb** offers an organized method for handling CSV data, maintaining consistency and simplicity of use for any individual seeking to carry out equivalent data conversions for this project.
